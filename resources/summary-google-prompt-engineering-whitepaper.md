Here's a summary of the [Google Prompt Engineering Whitepaper (Feb 2025)](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-prompt-engineering) focused on advanced content and insights potentially useful to you as an experienced LLM prompt creator and RAG/LLM developer:

## üîß Nontrivial Prompting Techniques

### 1. Step-back Prompting

- Breaks down complex tasks by first asking a broader or more general question
- Helps activate relevant latent knowledge in the LLM before tackling a specific query.
- Especially useful when generation seems too narrow or generic.
- Not commonly applied in many open RAG workflows‚Äîmight be a novel optimization point for you.

### 2. Self-Consistency

- Instead of greedy decoding, sample multiple diverse CoT responses with high temperature.
- Then, select the most consistent or majority answer.
- Useful for noisy or ambiguous classification tasks.
- Could be applied in your RAG eval pipelines for ranking or filtering LLM-generated answers.

### 3. Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
- Extends CoT by maintaining a branching tree of reasoning paths instead of a single chain.
- Potentially more aligned with deliberative RAG or agent-like reasoning.
- Practical if you're building systems that need breadth in exploration before narrowing down.

### 4. ReAct (Reason + Act)
- Interleaves natural language reasoning with actions (e.g. search, API calls).
- Described in the context of LangChain + SerpAPI for live search and aggregation tasks.
- If you're doing hybrid LLM-agent work, ReAct's prompt structure (Thought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Observation ‚Üí Thought...) may enhance retrieval + reasoning synergies.

### 5. Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE)
- Meta-prompts that generate prompt variants which are then scored (e.g. BLEU, ROUGE).
- You select high-performing variants for use or tuning.
- APE can bootstrap a dataset of diverse phrasing for retrieval augmentation or generation diversity.

## üß™ Output Control and Sampling Strategy
- Explains precise interplay between temperature, top-K, and top-P:
  - Highlights interactions where certain settings make others irrelevant (e.g. temperature = 0 makes top-K/P meaningless).
  - Recommends good starting combos:
    - General tasks: temp 0.2, top-P 0.95, top-K 30
    - Creative tasks: temp 0.9, top-P 0.99, top-K 40
    - Deterministic/math tasks: temp 0
- Repetition loops are flagged as a risk at both extremes (too deterministic or too random).

If you're manually adjusting decoding parameters for different prompt types or use cases, these interaction notes may help simplify tuning.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Prompt Best Practices of Note
- Use Instructions Over Constraints: Positive instructions are more effective than negated constraints. e.g., ‚ÄúList only the company, console, and year‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúDo not mention games.‚Äù
- Mix class orders in few-shot classification: Prevents biasing outputs toward the most frequent label class ordering‚Äîan under-discussed point.

## üìä Other Points You May Already Know (but Google Emphasizes)
- Clear distinctions among system, role, and contextual prompting (mostly covered in OpenAI docs too).
- Chain of Thought (CoT) boosting reasoning even in zero-shot with the classic ‚Äúlet‚Äôs think step by step.‚Äù
- Logging and documenting prompt attempts systematically‚ÄîGoogle encourages a table-based format.
