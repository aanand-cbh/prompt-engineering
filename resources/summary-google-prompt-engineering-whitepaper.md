Here's a summary of the [Google Prompt Engineering Whitepaper (Feb 2025)](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-prompt-engineering) focused on advanced content and insights potentially useful to you as an experienced LLM prompt creator and RAG/LLM developer:

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Imagine you have a super smart robot friend who knows a lot of stuff, but sometimes has trouble understanding exactly what you want. Prompt engineering is like learning the special words and ways to talk to this robot friend so it gives you the best answers possible!

## Why is it Important?

Think about when you ask your parents for something. If you say, "I want food!" they might give you anything. But if you say, "Can I please have a peanut butter sandwich with no crust?" you're more likely to get exactly what you want. Prompt engineering works the same way with AI!


### üìù Different Ways to Ask: (Trivial Techniques)

1. **Simple asking** (Zero-shot): "What is the capital of France?"
   
2. **Giving an example first** (One-shot): "For the USA, the capital is Washington D.C. What is the capital of France?"
   
3. **Giving multiple examples** (Few-shot): "For the USA, the capital is Washington D.C. For Japan, the capital is Tokyo. What is the capital of France?"
   
4. **Role play** (Role prompting): "Pretend you're a geography teacher. What is the capital of France?"
   
5. **Step-by-step thinking** (Chain of Thought): "To find the capital of France, I need to think about European countries and their main cities. France is in Western Europe, and its most important city historically and politically is..."


## üîß Nontrivial Prompting Techniques

### 1. Chain of Thought Prompting

This is like showing your work in math class! Instead of just saying the final answer, you ask the AI to explain each step.

**Example**: If you ask "If Tommy has 5 apples and gives 2 to Sally, how many does he have left?" the AI might just say "3 apples." But with Chain of Thought, it would say:
1. Tommy starts with 5 apples
2. Tommy gives 2 apples to Sally
3. 5 - 2 = 3
4. Tommy has 3 apples left


### 2. Step-back Prompting

Sometimes the best way to solve a hard problem is to take a step back and think about the bigger picture first!

For example: Instead of just asking "How do I build a treehouse?", first ask "What are the important parts of any building project?" Then use those answers to guide your treehouse plans.

- Breaks down complex tasks by first asking a broader or more general question
- Helps activate relevant latent knowledge in the LLM before tackling a specific query.
- Especially useful when generation seems too narrow or generic.
- Not commonly applied in many open RAG workflows‚Äîmight be a novel optimization point for you.

### 3. Self-Consistency

- Instead of greedy decoding, sample multiple diverse CoT responses with high temperature.
- Then, select the most consistent or majority answer.
- Useful for noisy or ambiguous classification tasks.
- Could be applied in your RAG eval pipelines for ranking or filtering LLM-generated answers.

### 4. Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

Imagine you're playing a video game and can try different paths to solve a puzzle. Tree of Thoughts lets the AI try different ways of thinking and pick the best one!

- Extends CoT by maintaining a branching tree of reasoning paths instead of a single chain.
- Potentially more aligned with deliberative RAG or agent-like reasoning.
- Practical if you're building systems that need breadth in exploration before narrowing down.

### 5. ReAct (Reason + Act)
- Interleaves natural language reasoning with actions (e.g. search, API calls).
- Described in the context of LangChain + SerpAPI for live search and aggregation tasks.
- If you're doing hybrid LLM-agent work, ReAct's prompt structure (Thought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Observation ‚Üí Thought...) may enhance retrieval + reasoning synergies.

### 6. Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE)
- Meta-prompts that generate prompt variants which are then scored (e.g. BLEU, ROUGE).
- You select high-performing variants for use or tuning.
- APE can bootstrap a dataset of diverse phrasing for retrieval augmentation or generation diversity.

## üß™ Output Control and Sampling Strategy

### üå°Ô∏è Temperature

Imagine you have a creativity dial for your robot friend:
- **Low temperature** (like 0): The robot gives boring but factual answers, like "2+2=4" every time
- **High temperature** (like 1): The robot gets super creative and might tell you wild stories about flying monkeys!

For example, if you ask "What's a cat?" with low temperature, it might say "A cat is a small furry pet animal." But with high temperature, it might say "A cat is a secret ninja warrior who pretends to sleep 16 hours a day but actually practices karate when you're not looking!"

- Explains precise interplay between temperature, top-K, and top-P:
  - Highlights interactions where certain settings make others irrelevant (e.g. temperature = 0 makes top-K/P meaningless).
  - Recommends good starting combos:
    - General tasks: temp 0.2, top-P 0.95, top-K 30
    - Creative tasks: temp 0.9, top-P 0.99, top-K 40
    - Deterministic/math tasks: temp 0
- Repetition loops are flagged as a risk at both extremes (too deterministic or too random).

If you're manually adjusting decoding parameters for different prompt types or use cases, these interaction notes may help simplify tuning.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Tips for Great Prompts:

1. **Be super clear**: "Write a poem about a blue dolphin with exactly 4 lines" is better than "Write a dolphin poem"

2. **Give examples**: Show what a good answer looks like

3. **Ask for step-by-step answers**: This helps the AI think better!

4. **Try different ways of asking**: If you don't get a good answer the first time, try asking differently

5. **Be polite**: Even robot friends like when you say please and thank you!

- Use Instructions Over Constraints: Positive instructions are more effective than negated constraints. e.g., ‚ÄúList only the company, console, and year‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúDo not mention games.‚Äù
- Mix class orders in few-shot classification: Prevents biasing outputs toward the most frequent label class ordering‚Äîan under-discussed point.

## üìä Other Points You May Already Know (but Google Emphasizes)
- Remember: Prompt engineering is like learning a special language to talk to AI friends. The better you get at it, the more amazing things you can do together!
- Clear distinctions among system, role, and contextual prompting (mostly covered in OpenAI docs too).
- Chain of Thought (CoT) boosting reasoning even in zero-shot with the classic ‚Äúlet‚Äôs think step by step.‚Äù
- Logging and documenting prompt attempts systematically‚ÄîGoogle encourages a table-based format.
